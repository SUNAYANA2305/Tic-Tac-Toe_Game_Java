Tic-Tac-Toe
Code an interactive, two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe that has a graphical user interface with a decent AI module (you play against the computer and the computer should not play randomly).

Details of the game:

The idea is to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe (which is a two player game) with/against the computer. Thus there will be one player in front of the computer and the second player will be played by the computer itself. You should ask whether the computer start first or the player starts first. 

The implementation is in a graphical manner. 

It contains HELP button/page that displays rules of the game and the month/day/year when you finished the implementation.
